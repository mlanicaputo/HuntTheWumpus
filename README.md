# HuntTheWumpus
A project I did for Data Structures &amp; Algorithms at Colby College with Professor Naser Al Madi. The project contains LinkedList, Vertex, and Graph data structure classes programmed from scratch. It also provides implementation for a playable version of the 1970s game Hunt the Wumpus.
